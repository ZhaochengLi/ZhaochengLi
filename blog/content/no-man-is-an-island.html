    <h1>"No Man Is An Island" - John Donne</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="intro">John Donne(22/01/1572 - 31/03/1631) was an English poet and cleric in thie Church of England.</p>
    <p class="intro">He is considered the pre-eminent representitive of the metaphysical posts. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnetsm love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons.</p>
    <p class="intro">His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society and he met that knowledge with sharp criticism. Another important theme in Donne's poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorized. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits.</p>
    <p class="intro">The phrases "no man is an island" comes from his prose, <a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"">Devotoions Upon Emergent Occasions</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="intro">No man is an island entire of itself;</p>
      <p>every man is a piece of the continent,</p>
      <p>a part of the main;</p>
      <p>if a clod be washed away by the sea,</p>
      <p>Europe is the less,</p>
      <p>as well as if a promontory were,</p>
      <p>as well as any manor of thy friends or of thine own were;</p>
      <p>any man's death diminishes me,</p>
      <p>because I am involved in mankind.</p>
      <p>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;</p>
      <p>it tolls for thee.</p>

      <p>没有谁是一座孤岛 - 约翰·多恩</p>
      <p>没有谁是一座孤岛</p>
      <p>在大海里独踞</p>
      <p>每个人都像一块小小的泥土</p>
      <p>连接成整个陆地</p>
      <p>如果有一块泥土被海水冲刷</p>
      <p>欧洲就会失去一角</p>
      <p>这如同一座山岬</p>
      <p>也如同一座庄园</p>
      <p>无论是你的还是你朋友的</p>
      <p>无论谁死了</p>
      <p>都是我的一部分在死去</p>
      <p>因为我包含在人类这个概念里</p>
      <p>因此</p>
      <p>不要问丧钟为谁而鸣</p>
      <p>丧钟为你而鸣</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>没有人能自全，</p>
      <p>没有人是孤岛，</p>
      <p>每人都是大陆的一片，</p>
      <p>要为本土应卯那便是一块土地，</p>
      <p>那便是一方海角，</p>
      <p>那便是一座庄园，</p>
      <p>不论是你的、</p>
      <p>还是朋友的，</p>
      <p>一旦海水冲走，</p>
      <p>欧洲就要变小。</p>
      <p>任何人的死亡，</p>
      <p>都是我的减少，</p>
      <p>作为人类的一员，</p>
      <p>我与生灵共老。</p>
      <p>丧钟在为谁敲，</p>
      <p>我本茫然不晓，</p>
      <p>不为幽明永隔，</p>
      <p>它正为你哀悼。</p>
